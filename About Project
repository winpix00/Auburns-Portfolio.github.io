Houston Flood Analysis (Master’s Project, 2024–2025)

Conducted a GIS-based study of flood risk in Houston between 2014 and 2023, analyzing the relationship between land use change, impervious surface growth, and flood vulnerability.

Utilized ArcGIS Pro to integrate parcel-level land value data, FEMA flood zones, and land change rasters.

Applied spatial statistics and proportional distribution methods to quantify land use types within high- and low-risk flood zones. 

Identified patterns of urban expansion increasing exposure to flooding, due to many geographical and statistical differences.

Produced maps, charts, and reports to support policy recommendations for sustainable land use and flood mitigation planning.
